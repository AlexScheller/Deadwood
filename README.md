# Deadwood

This project is a Java implementation of the Boardgame [Deadwood](http://cheapass.com/free-games/deadwood/) from Cheapass games. Note that this project is very much in development. The model and controller are essentially done but heavy work is needed on the GraphicalView. Even when that's finished A lot of refactoring will need to be done.
