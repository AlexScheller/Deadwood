Currently many methods throw exceptions when they are called at the wrong
time. e.g. takeRole(String which) is called, even though the player shouldn't
be able to take the given role. This leads to a lot of exceptions being caught
and simply thrown away, because they aren't actually game breaking. This should
be changed in one of two ways. Either these methods should c-style return
a boolean indicating success or failure, or they should require an additional
function call that checks to see if they can be validly called with given
input. I lean towards the former. Some exceptions should remain however in the
cases where a function call is actually game breaking, these cases should all
have comments justifying the use of an Exception.

Currently all exceptions must now have an accompanying comment justifying
their existence.
