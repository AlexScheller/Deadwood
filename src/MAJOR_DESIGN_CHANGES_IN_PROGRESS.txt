In its current state the model was written with the console view in mind. Too
much so. The model is currently littered with methods that return strings
containing results of various actions, intended for display in the console view.
A more proper way of handling the exchange of information is to pass the model
listener deeper into the model, in order to react to model updates directly,
rather than wait for some (possibly mis-constructed) textual response. Currently
the model is undergoing a major overhaul to correct this. This will also mean
that the console view will need to be updated to re-conform to the updated
ModelListener interface.

Additional refactoring is being done in cases where Classes were exposing their
behavior unnecessarily, and in some cases behavior is being pushed into
classes where it was previously extracted further up the class hierarchy.
